# 🧩 Maze Solver (Recursive & Iterative)

This project implements a **maze solver** in Java using both **recursive backtracking** and **iterative depth-first search (DFS)** with a stack.  
The program explores a maze represented by a 2D character array to find a path from a **Start (S)** position to a **Finish (F)** position.
