# Singly Linked List - Playlist Manager

### Project 1: Singly Linked List

This project implements a simple playlist manager using a singly linked list in Java.
The playlist stores Song objects, each with a title and artist. You can:

- Add songs to the playlist.

- Remove songs by title.

- Display all songs in order.

- Play the next song in the playlist (with looping behavior).

The project demonstrates how to work with linked lists, node traversal, and dynamic data structures.
